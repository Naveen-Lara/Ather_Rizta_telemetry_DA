#  Ather Rizta S: Electric Scooter Performance Analysis

##  Problem Statement

Ather Energy, a leading electric scooter manufacturer, wants to understand how operational parameters influence real-world electric scooter performance. Specifically, the Ather Rizta S model is evaluated under daily commuting conditions to assess how tyre pressure, ride modes, and battery health contribute to performance variation.

The vehicle is equipped with smart BMS, TPMS, and supports multiple ride modes (Zip, Smart Eco). Data was generated to emulate production-level telemetry logs under AIS-compliant standards.

##  Objective

The primary objective of this project is:

> **To analyze how tyre pressure, battery metrics, and ride modes affect electric scooter performance, specifically focusing on efficiency, speed, and range.**

The study aims to:

* Identify correlations among tyre pressure, motor load, discharge current, and SOC drop.
* Evaluate performance consistency under real-world noise, degradation, and sensor drift.
* Align with India's **CAFE (Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency)** and **AIS-137 Part 3** standards for COâ‚‚ reduction compliance.
